### Q1
```{r}
# create data.frame
# response = The number of molds of the algae = NMA
# columns = five levels of PH = PH = 1:5
# Greek letters = five levels of temperature = Temp
# rows = vessels = vess = 1:5
# Latin letters = algae types = Type
NMA <- c(57,55,74,17,30,47,43,14,31,70,60,38,56,47,17,40,23,26,61,70,19,71,54,23,44)
vess = gl(n = 5,k=1,length = 25,c(1:5))
PH = gl(n = 5,k=5,length = 25,c(1:5))
Temp <- c( "C","B","E","A","D", 
          "D","C","A","B","E", 
          "E","D","B","C","A", 
          "B","A","D","E","C", 
          "A","E","C","D","B")
Type <- c( "O","P","Q","R","S", 
           "R","Q","O","S","P", 
           "S","O","R","P","Q", 
           "Q","S","P","O","R", 
           "P","R","S","Q","O") #using O:S for Latin letters

GLSDdata <- data.frame(vess, Temp, PH, Type,NMA)
head(GLSDdata,10)


```
```{r}
# (a)construct the ANOVA table for the above design.
myGLSD <- aov(NMA ~ vess+Temp+PH+Type, GLSDdata)
summary(myGLSD)
```
```{r}
#plot the results
plot(myGLSD)
```

```{r}
#(b)Formally test to determine if temperature affects the growth
  #if it does, what temperature result in significantly different growth?
#multiple comparsion using TukeyHSD function
myTukeyTemp <- TukeyHSD(myGLSD,"Temp")
myTukeyTemp
```
```{r}
#(c)Formally test to determine if algae type affects the growth.
  #if it does, what algae type result in significantly different growth?
myTukeyType <- TukeyHSD(myGLSD,"Type")
myTukeyType
```
```{r}
#(d)Formally test to determine if pH affects the growth
  #if it does what pH levels results in significantly different growth?
myTukeyPH <- TukeyHSD(myGLSD,"PH")
myTukeyPH
```
```{r}
#(e)Formally test to determine if the size of vessel affects the growth?
  #if it does, what vessel sizes produce significantly different results?
myTukeyVess <- TukeyHSD(myGLSD,"vess")
myTukeyVess
```

### Q2
```{r}
# create data.frame
# two factors, three levels, and two replicates

YieldCP=c(90.4,90.2,90.1,90.3,90.5,90.7,90.7,90.6,90.5,90.6,90.8,90.9,90.2,90.4,89.9,90.1,90.4,90.1)
Tempe_B= gl(n = 3,k=2,length = 18,labels = c(150,160,170))# 3 levels and 2 rows
Pres_A= gl(n = 3,k=6,length = 18,labels = c(200,215,230))# 3 levels and 6 rows
d=data.frame(YieldCP,Tempe_B,Pres_A)
head(d,10)
```

```{r}
# (a)Analyze the data and draw conclusions, alpha = 0.05
# create ANOVA table by using aov function 
av1=aov(YieldCP~ Pres_A*Tempe_B) # factor and A, B and interaction A*B
summary(av1)
```

```{r}
# find the model without interaction
av2 <- aov(YieldCP ~ Pres_A + Tempe_B)
summary(av2)
```


```{r}
# (b)Prepare aoorioruate residual plots and comment on the models's adequacy
#plot residuals and QQ plot
#par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(av1)
### the plot shows the residuals are stay closed in the normal line and no pattern in fitted values
### 
```
```{r}
# interaction plot
interaction.plot(x.factor = Pres_A,trace.factor = Tempe_B,response = YieldCP,fun = mean)
```

```{r}
# (c)Under what conditions would you operate this process?
### the interation plot suggests that set pressure at 215 and temperature 170 degree will 
### gives you the highest  yield.
### since the both factors are quantitative, we can perform the linear regression
### the ANOVA shows that no interation significant
m1 <- lm(YieldCP ~ Pres_A+Tempe_B, data=d)
summary(m1)
```

```{r}
plot(m1)
```
